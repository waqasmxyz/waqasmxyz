- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @waqasmxyz and I am a Front End Developer.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m personally interested in creating productivity, management and learning applications, both web and desktop.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently practicing Javascript and Python.

- âš¡ Fun fact: After a decade of creating 3D art for games and launching two titles on console and PC, I decided to upskill my career. I have now added front-end development to my skill set and am thoroughly enjoying coding front-end applications while exploring the capabilities of Python.
